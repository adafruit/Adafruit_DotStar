# Adafruit DotStar [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar/actions)

Arduino library for controlling two-wire-based LED pixels and strips such as Adafruit DotStar LEDs and other APA102-compatible devices.

Update:  This has been updated to work with the MKR-RGB Shield and the Portanta_H7.  A jumper must be placed from A3->A5.
