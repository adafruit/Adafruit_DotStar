/* ISSUE DATA TO LED STRIP -------------------------------------------------

  Although the LED driver has an additional per-pixel 5-bit brightness
  setting, it is NOT used or supported here. On APA102, the normally
  very fast PWM is gated through a much slower PWM (about 400 Hz),
  rendering it useless for POV or other high-speed things that are
  probably why one is using DotStars instead of NeoPixels in the first
  place. I'm told that some APA102 clones use current control rather than
  PWM for this, which would be much more worthwhile. Still, no support
  here, no plans for it. If you really can't live without it, you can fork
  the library and add it for your own use, but any pull requests for this
  are unlikely be merged for the foreseeable future.

                over" while still doing the expected thing (and allowing

  // (not 1536, more on that below), but the full unsigned 16-bit type was

  // So you'd think that the color "hexcone" (the thing that ramps from
  // pure red, to pure yellow, to pure green and so forth back to red,
  // yielding six slices), and with each color component having 256
  // possible values (0-255), might have 1536 possible items (6*256),
  // but in reality there's 1530. This is because the last element in
  // each 256-element slice is equal to the first element of the next
  // slice, and keeping those in there this would create small
  // discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each
  // slice is dropped...we regard only elements 0-254, with item 255
  // being picked up as element 0 of the next slice. Like this:
  // Red to not-quite-pure-yellow is:        255,   0, 0 to 255, 254,   0
  // Pure yellow to not-quite-pure-green is: 255, 255, 0 to   1, 255,   0
  // Pure green to not-quite-pure-cyan is:     0, 255, 0 to   0, 255, 254
  // and so forth. Hence, 1530 distinct hues (0 to 1529), and hence why
